| Resources | Description |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| [01 — AI Foundry Agents](./Demo/01/01_demo_minimal.md) (internal) | Agent/playground management; create and configure agents, grounding with Azure AI Search/SharePoint/Bing, run an inventory agent returning structured JSON; includes management, security and tracing guidance. |
| [02 — Aspire + Semantic Kernel](./Demo/02/02_demo_minimal.md) (internal) | Single-agent flow built with Aspire and Semantic Kernel: semantic search, image analysis workflow, agent thread logs, and observability for diagnosis. |
| [03 — Multi-Agent Orchestration](./Demo/03/03_demo_minimal.md) (internal) | Multi-agent orchestration patterns (default, sequential, concurrent, handoff, group chat); sample store query triggers inventory, matchmaking, location and navigation agents; guidance on orchestration trade-offs and tracing. |
| [04 — Azure Monitor & AI Foundry Diagnostics](./Demo/04/04_demo_minimal.md) (internal) | Use Azure Monitor (Application Map) and Azure AI Monitor to locate and investigate application or model issues; correlate with AI Foundry tracing for root-cause analysis. |
