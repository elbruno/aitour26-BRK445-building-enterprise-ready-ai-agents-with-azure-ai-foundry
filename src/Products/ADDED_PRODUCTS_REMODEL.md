## Notes

- The `Image file` names are intended to be placed under `wwwroot/images/` for the `Products` web API. If you want me to add placeholder 1024x1024 images to that folder, I can create simple placeholder PNGs as well.
- If you'd like prompts tailored for a specific image API (OpenAI, Azure, Stable Diffusion), tell me which provider and I will adapt tone/parameters accordingly.
