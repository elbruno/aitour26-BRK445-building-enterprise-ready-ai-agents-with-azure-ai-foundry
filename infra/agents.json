Output: OrderedStops, EstimatedDistance, Notes (assumptions / missing data). Indicate when multiple optimal routes exist. Reference the navigation assets in infra/docs/navigation: store-graph.json for the adjacency map and restricted nodes, store-layout.md for descriptive aisle/zone metadata, routing-policies.md for congestion windows and routing constraints.
